🔧 NetRakshak – Offline AI-Powered Network Troubleshooting Assistant

NetRakshak is a lightweight, locally-run troubleshooting assistant built using a quantized LLM (Phi-3 Mini via Ollama). It helps non-technical users diagnose and resolve common network issues — without needing internet access or tech expertise.

This AI bot mimics the behavior of a real network technician by interacting in natural language, executing low-level system tools, and walking the user through each diagnostic step using a ReAct loop.
